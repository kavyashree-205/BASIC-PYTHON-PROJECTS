*****BASIC PYTHON PROJECTS*****

******1.ATM-SIMULATOR******


The main aim of this project is to demonstrate how an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) works and functions as like ATM machine.
The operations performed are:



1.BALENCE ENQUIRY:
               It provides the balance amount associated to their bank account. The user is requested to enter their ATM PIN which is a 4 - digit number and the balance amount is executed.  


2.PIN UPDATON:
              The user is requested to enter their current ATM PIN and asked to enter the new pin they want to setup and hence the pin gets updated.


3.CASH WITHDRAWL:
              The user is asked to enter ATM PIN and the amount to withdraw. After the withdrawl the balance amount in the account is shown.


4.CASH DEPOSIT:
              The user is asked to enter pin and the amount to deposit to account and then the current balance is shown.


5.MONEY TRANSFER:
              The user is requested to enter their PIN numbers and the account number to which they want to transfer money and then  asked to enter the amount to transfer. At last the balance amount is shown for both the accounts.

I have used python dictionary data structure to store the users infomation.
